Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
While I certainly don't feel like a full-stack developer yet, I understand git
and its potential and efficiency, and am getting much better at writing
algorithms using loops and logic statements. The challenge yesterday really
showed me the importance of breaking down the big problem in to multiple smaller
ones. I'm excited to start working with actual WEB development and get some
html/css going and even more excited for learning data base languages.
